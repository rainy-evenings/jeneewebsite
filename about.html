        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>I am Jeneé White,</h3> 
        <p>born from Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in the small town of Derry, New Hampshire. As an aspiring individual, my passion lies in pursuing art directing for movies, video games, and advertising. Growing up, I was enthralled by the process of creating art.  I have always loved witnessing the creative process from as early as 11 years old. As a child, I spent most of my time in front of a screen, admiring the artwork of many online creators. At this point, I became completely enthralled with the joy of creating. I started my artistic journey as a teenager by studying thousands of bits and pieces of work by different artists, which led me to finally apply the same type of thinking to my own work. I've improved my knowledge from watching simple online tutorials to now pursuing my artistic interests.</p>
        <p>My interest in art expanded rapidly as I learned more about other mediums and methods. I tried a variety of methods, refining my technique with persistence and repetition. With every brushstroke, mouse click, or stylus swipe, I was able to create fresh and innovative methods to express myself. I eventually found my own style as an artist, fusing realistic aspects with abstract ideas to produce compositions that are striking to look at. My artistic journey has been one of self-discovery and personal development, driven by an unwavering love for artistic expression.</p>
        <p>I am always taking in inspiration from the world around me as I work toward my goal of becoming an art director. Every moment serves as an inspiration for my art, whether it's the bustling streets of a metropolis or the serene beauty of the outdoors. By my creative pursuits, I hope to push the boundaries of artistic creativity and make a lasting effect on the world.</p>
